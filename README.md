---Devlog---

June 3rd, 2022

    AAAAHHHHHHHHHHH setting up this whole tech stack thing is suck a nightmare. I barely understand what webpack is for. Sure, I get that webpack dev server is crazy useful, but are there other things it's doing that are more impactful than live reloading? I have no idea, because I have barely any idea what it does in the first place.

    As an aside, everything is working in the stack now. I have all my usual stuff plus Jest. But now I need to figure out how to get jest running at the same time as the dev server, because if I have to close the server to run testing, it completely defeats the purpose of the server. I think I did find a page on how to do it, though. 
    
    As another aside, I also barely understand the point of writing tests by hand. I can imagine larger test suites to automate testing different cases, but after hours of reading and watching content regarding the uses of testing, I still don't get it. Maybe over time, it'll make more sense, but like with a lot of the stuff I'm reading about, when I can't associate it immediately with a potential use case, I barely care. Hopefully over time I will care more. Maybe if I make a bunch of tests like it seems this project is pushing me to do. I get that console.log is overused, but how is it not ten thousand times more convenient in so many use cases? I write a test, it fails completely. Where did it fail? How far back in the operations? I have no idea until I go and see different values at different points! I'm really hoping that future me will come back to this devlog and say, "Why, that young Seb so full of energy, it only took mildly degenerate smut for him to pop a chubby, and he thought testing and webpack were wastes of time!" 

    For the time being, this is largely frustrating. And I imagine a future where I spend eight hours setting up my tech stack before I can even begin conceptualizing a project. But I also imagine a future where I've learned some sort of stack generator that just builds all this boilerplate stuff for me. Or I may even understand how all these different pieces work one day. There's hope yet. 

    There are relatively straighforward ways to run the server and testing at the same time. And then there's having two terminals open. Yikes on me.
